## Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Research

### Background/Motivation
Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have garnered significant attention due to their substantial price volatility. Existing literature spans statistical, econometric, and machine learning methods to predict cryptocurrency prices. This research aims to contribute to this growing field by addressing current limitations and proposing innovative predictive models.

### Research Questions
This research aims to answer the following specific questions:
1. How does the LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model perform in predicting the prices of various cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin?
2. Can the performance of LSTM in cryptocurrency price prediction be enhanced by integrating other machine learning models or techniques?
3. What are the comparative dynamics and predictive powers of lesser-known cryptocurrencies versus major ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum?

### Methodology

#### Overview of Machine Learning Models
- **LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly suited for learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. LSTMs are designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem that can occur with RNNs, making them effective in modeling sequences of data for applications such as time series prediction (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997).
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: A popular statistical model used for time series analysis. It combines autoregression, differencing (to make the time series stationary), and a moving average model. This model is particularly effective in handling data where values are correlated over time (Box and Jenkins, 1976).
- **Linear Regression**: A fundamental statistical approach where the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables is modeled. It's used for forecasting and predicting outcomes (Montgomery et al., 2012).
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time to output the mode of classes (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees (Breiman, 2001).
- **Gradient Boosting Regressors**: This is a machine learning technique for regression problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees (Friedman, 2001).

#### Detailed Methodology
- The research employs the LSTM model to predict cryptocurrency prices.
- Comparative analysis with alternative algorithms like ARIMA, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Regressors will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the LSTM model in predicting cryptocurrency prices.
- The study will encompass a range of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum, to understand the predictive power across various market caps and volatility levels.
