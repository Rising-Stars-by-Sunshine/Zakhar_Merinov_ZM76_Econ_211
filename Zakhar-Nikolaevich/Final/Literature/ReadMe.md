# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Research

## Introduction to Existing Literature

Cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin, have experienced substantial price volatility, garnering significant research interest. A seminal survey by Temesgen Awoke, Minakhi Rout, Lipika Mohanty, and Suresh Chandra Satapathy in "Bitcoin Price Prediction and Analysis Using Deep Learning Models" (2020) encapsulates various deep learning techniques, such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), for Bitcoin price prediction. Additionally, recent studies have further developed predictive models using hybrid techniques, demonstrating superior forecasting performance (Atsalakis et al., 2019).

## My Research: Similarities and Advancements

### Similarities:
My research builds upon these foundational studies, using machine learning techniques for cryptocurrency price prediction. It aligns with prior works in exploring the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets through machine learning algorithms.

### Advancements:
Diverging from existing literature, my research uniquely focuses on a broader range of cryptocurrencies, extending beyond Bitcoin. It aims to identify correlations in price dynamics across various cryptocurrencies, offering new insights into their potential market movements.

### Novel Contributions:
1. **Broader Cryptocurrency Spectrum**: Unlike prior studies predominantly on Bitcoin, this research includes a more extensive range of cryptocurrencies.
2. **Comparative Dynamics Analysis**: A novel endeavor to uncover price movement similarities among diverse cryptocurrencies.
3. **Predictive Power of Lesser-Known Coins**: This research contributes to understanding the predictive value of lesser-known cryptocurrencies in market trend analysis.

## Conclusion

This research expands on existing literature by examining a wider array of cryptocurrencies and their interconnected price dynamics, enriching the understanding of cryptocurrency market prediction.
