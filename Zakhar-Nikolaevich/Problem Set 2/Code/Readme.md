# README for Data Query Process

## Overview
This README details a comprehensive data query process designed for versatility across various programming environments, including Python, Java, and Go. The process involves several critical stages, from initial data acquisition to in-depth analysis and model evaluation. 

Starting with the importation of essential libraries, the procedure advances through data loading, meticulous preprocessing, and rigorous statistical testing. This foundation sets the stage for the core of the process: model training using sophisticated techniques such as Linear Regression and ARIMA. The culmination of this workflow is a thorough evaluation of the model's performance, leveraging metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) Score. This structured approach ensures a robust and scalable framework for analyzing complex datasets.
