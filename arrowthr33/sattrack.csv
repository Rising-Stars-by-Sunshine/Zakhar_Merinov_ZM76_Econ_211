Machine learning-based ship detection and tracking using satellite images for maritime surveillance,"The recent advancement in remote sensing technologies has resulted in the availability of different imaging modes and higher resolution satellite images. Accessibility of these remote sensing or satellite images, automatic ship detection and tracking has become an important research topic in the field of maritime surveillance. In this paper, a novel method for ship detection using satellite images is proposed. First the preprocessing is carried out to remove the noise from the images using Ship Detection and Tracking (SDT) filter. Then, the land masking (sea-land area separation) and cloud masking is carried out based on the gradient feature extraction using SDT edge detection, along with SDT segmentation. Finally, the ships are identified using the Machine Learning (ML) classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), KNN, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes-based classifier based on the features extracted from Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). The proposed work is cross validated using the Google earth data. Performance of our proposed method is evaluated using the recall and the precision values. Further, for tracking ships, an improved multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm is proposed and tested using the Kaggle dataset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The recent advancement in remote sensing technologies has resulted in the availability of different imaging modes and higher resolution satellite images.

"Hash-Based Deep Learning Approach for Remote Sensing
Satellite Imagery Detection","Ship detection plays a crucial role in marine security in remote sensing imagery. This
paper discusses about a deep learning approach to detect the ships from satellite imagery. The
model developed in this work achieves integrity by the inclusion of hashing. This model employs
a supervised image classification technique to classify images, followed by object detection using
You Only Look Once version 3 (YOLOv3) to extract features from deep CNN. Semantic segmentation
and image segmentation is done to identify object category of each pixel using class labels. Then,
the concept of hashing using SHA-256 is applied in conjunction with the ship count and location
of bounding box in satellite image. The proposed model is tested on a Kaggle Ships dataset, which
consists of 231,722 images. A total of 70% of this data is used for training, and the 30% is used for
testing. To add security to images with detected ships, the model is enhanced by hashing using
SHA-256 algorithm. Using SHA-256, which is a one-way hash, the data are split up into blocks of
64 bytes. The input data to the hash function are both the ship count and bounding box location.
The proposed model achieves integrity by using SHA-256. This model allows secure transmission of
highly confidential images that are tamper-proof.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
